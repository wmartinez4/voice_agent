JESS VOICE AGENT - Proof of Concept
====================================

WHAT IS JESS?
AI-powered voice agent for empathetic debt collection. Sounds like a real person, NOT a traditional collector. Calls customers, verifies identity, negotiates flexible payment plans, and logs results automatically.

POC SCOPE
✅ Privacy-first identity verification (name confirmation before revealing debt)
✅ Natural, empathetic conversation (no pressure or corporate language)
✅ Automated payment plan negotiation (2-4 installments or discounts)
✅ Real-time API integration (Supabase + FastAPI + ElevenLabs + Twilio)
✅ Automatic call outcome logging

HOW IT WORKS (Happy Path)
1. Jess calls → Casual greeting
2. Confirms identity with real name (no debt info yet)
3. Mentions specific debt: amount & days overdue
4. Customer can't pay all → Jess offers installment plan/discount
5. Customer accepts → Jess confirms & promises SMS
6. Logs commitment to database & says goodbye
Natural 1-2 min conversation. No pressure.


CONVERSATION EXAMPLE
--------------------
Jess: "Hi! Am I speaking with Willian Martinez?"
Customer: "Yes"
Jess: "I'm calling about an outstanding balance of $664 from 7 days ago. Were you aware?"
Customer: "Yes, but I can't pay it all now"
Jess: "I understand. We can divide it. Would 2, 3, or 4 payments work better?"
Customer: "3 would work"
Jess: "Perfect, $221.33 each. What dates work for you?"
Customer: "The 25th monthly"
Jess: "Excellent. I'll send confirmation. Thank you!"
Result: Committed to 3 payments. Logged automatically.

TOOLS JESS USES
1. get_customer_name → Retrieves customer's name
2. get_case_details → Gets debt amount, overdue days, risk level
3. propose_payment_plan → Calculates installment plans or validates discount offers
4. update_status → Logs call outcome (payment promise, refusal, callback, etc.)
