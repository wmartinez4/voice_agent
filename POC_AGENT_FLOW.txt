JESS VOICE AGENT - Proof of Concept
====================================

WHAT IS JESS?
AI-powered voice agent for empathetic debt collection. Sounds like a real person, NOT a traditional collector. Calls customers, verifies identity, negotiates flexible payment plans, and logs results automatically.

POC SCOPE
✅ Privacy-first identity verification (name confirmation before revealing debt)
✅ Natural, empathetic conversation (no pressure or corporate language)
✅ Automated payment plan negotiation (2-4 installments or discounts)
✅ Real-time API integration (Supabase + FastAPI + ElevenLabs + Twilio)
✅ Automatic call outcome logging

HOW IT WORKS (Happy Path)
1. Jess calls → Casual greeting: "Hi! This is Jess. Am I speaking with the account holder?"
2. Calls API to get customer's name (privacy-first approach)
3. Confirms identity: "Am I speaking with [Name]?"
4. ONLY AFTER confirmation → Mentions specific debt: amount & days overdue
5. Customer can't pay all → Jess offers installment plan/discount
6. Customer accepts → Jess confirms & promises SMS confirmation
7. Logs commitment to database & says goodbye
Natural 2-3 min conversation. No pressure, no corporate language.


CONVERSATION EXAMPLE
--------------------
Jess: "Hi! This is Jess. Am I speaking with the account holder?"
Customer: "Yes, that's me"
Jess: [Calls get_customer_name API] "Perfect! Am I speaking with Willian Martinez?"
Customer: "Yes, that's me"
Jess: [Calls get_case_details API] "I'm calling about something quick I noticed. There's an outstanding balance of $664 from about 7 days ago. Were you aware of this pending amount?"
Customer: "Yes, but I can't pay it all right now"
Jess: "I completely understand. It happens sometimes. Could you handle it today in full, or would you prefer we divide it into installments?"
Customer: "I'd prefer installments"
Jess: "We can do it in 2, 3, or 4 payments, whatever works best for you."
Customer: "3 would work"
Jess: [Calls propose_payment_plan API] "Perfect, that would be $221.33 each. What dates work for you?"
Customer: "The 25th of each month"
Jess: "Excellent. So we're agreed on 3 installments of $221.33, starting December 25th. Confirmed?"
Customer: "Yes, confirmed"
Jess: [Calls update_status API] "Perfect. I'll send you confirmation via text in 2 minutes. Thank you for your time, Willian. Have an excellent day."
Result: Payment promise logged. Customer committed to 3-payment plan.

TOOLS JESS USES
1. get_customer_name → Retrieves customer's name
2. get_case_details → Gets debt amount, overdue days, risk level
3. propose_payment_plan → Calculates installment plans or validates discount offers
4. update_status → Logs call outcome (payment promise, refusal, callback, etc.)
